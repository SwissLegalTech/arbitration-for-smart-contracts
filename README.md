# Smarbico - Dispute resolution for Smart Contracts

Based on the smart contract, a party shall get ways of access to customised customer service and problem solving 
And, if no standard resolution process applies, get access to an automated, as independent as possible and standardised dispute settlement system across different platforms and smart contracts.
Easy access to cheap arbitration for customers and businesses.
Settled disputes are resolved in enforceable decisions (as far as possible under mandatory processual rules).
